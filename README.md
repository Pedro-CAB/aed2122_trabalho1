It allows a user to list flights from an origin or to a destination, see available seats, buy a ticket, set their luggage up and manage occuring flights and maintenance/cleaning services in vehicles. It was developed for the course of Algorithms and Data Structures in the 2nd year of the Informatics Engineering and Computation at FEUP.
